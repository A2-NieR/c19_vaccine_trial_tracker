This tool was built to get a quick overview of clinical trials of current vaccines for Covid-19.

Data is gathered from [clinicaltrials.gov](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov) using their API.

The data gets extracted and is put into a sortable table showing the following details for each trial:

- Official title
- Study phase
- Study start date
- Study completion date
- The date of the last update
- The number of participants
- The NCTId, which is also used to link to the specific trial
